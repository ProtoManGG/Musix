# **Musix: A Music App for Credixco Tech** 🪕

## 🤔❓ **_The Problem Statement:_** 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️

App should be made only using bloc pattern, In the following video you can see that first there is a list of music loading, and when the loading is finished you can see any track’s details by tapping on it and then navigating to the next screen, where you have to show the track details using the TRACK_ID of the track which you get in the first screen or first API, and the lyrics using the same TRACK_ID you used to fetch the track details.

You must handle the case that if the internet is not working, you show a message "NO INTERNET CONNECTION". This step will check your state management with the bloc pattern.

There are three APIs used in the Screens:

The first API is used to show the list of the movies in the first screen.

The second API used in the second screen which will use the id, which you will get from the previous API, using that TRACK_ID you will show the track details.

The third API is used on the same screen as the second API, so you will use the same TRACK_ID used in that here to fetch and display the lyrics.

Note: You must make 2 Separate screens to perform this task, using 3 different APIs.

Note: The Second and third API contain the word TRACK_ID, you must replace that word with the ID, which you will get from the first API for the tapped music item.

🐮 _**Optional Task**_:

A bookmark button on the music details screen, which will save the TRACK_ID and Track Name on the device’s local storage. You will then use the saved information to make a third “Bookmarks” Page, where it will display the names of the saved tracks, and clicking on them will load the music details screen using the TRACK_ID that was saved along with it
